Overview
---
Detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  

The complete project consists of two files: a Jupyter notebook for project code [code](https://github.com/zardosht/udacity_selfdriving_car/blob/master/P1_Finding_Lane_Lines/P1.ipynb) and a file containing a brief write up explaining the solution [writeup](https://github.com/zardosht/udacity_selfdriving_car/blob/master/P1_Finding_Lane_Lines/writeup_template.md). The writeup describes the solution pipelines, shortcommings, and suggestions for improvement. 

The requirements to pass the project: [project rubric](./P1_Project_Rubric.pdf)



# Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree
Projects from Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. 
Each project is in its corresponding folder. I have named the projects consecutively from P1 to P9. The program consists of two parts: 

  * Part 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensors (P1 to P5):
  	* Project 1: Finding Lane Lines
  	* Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding
  	* Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier
  	* Project 4: Behavioral Cloning
  	* Project 5: Extended Kaman Filters 
  
  
  * Part 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration (P6 to P9): 
  	* Project 6: Localization
  	* Project 7: Path Planning
  	* Project 8: PID Controller
  	* Project 9: System Integration and Deployment
